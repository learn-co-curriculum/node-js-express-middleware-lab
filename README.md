# Node.js Express Middleware Lab

## Objectives

1. Practice using middleware in Express
2. Build a small web application that leverages middleware for clean routes

## Introduction

We want to test both global and route-specific middlewares. We can even push students to use predefined middleware like `bodyParser()`.

As for narrative, we can build an app that has students getting a place in line and moving up? You can only move one place at a time (this will require an in-memory 'database' in app.js), and you have to get a ticket to start the whole process.
